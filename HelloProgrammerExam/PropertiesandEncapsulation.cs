    /*Why Encapsulation?
Better control of class members (reduce the possibility of yourself (or others) to mess up the code)
Fields can be made read-only (if you only use the get method),
    or write-only (if you only use the set method)
Flexible: the programmer can change one part of the code
    without affecting other parts
Increased security of data*/
