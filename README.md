HelloProgrammerExam
A C# Learning Repository ‚Äî Demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming Concepts with Practical Examples

üìå Overview
This repository contains a collection of C# classes, interfaces, and examples designed to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as:

Access Modifiers

Encapsulation

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Abstraction

Interfaces

Constructors & Method Overloading

It is intended for learners who want to understand and practice C# OOP concepts in a clear, structured way.

üõ† Features & Concepts Covered
1. Access Modifiers
Demonstrates public, private, protected, internal, protected internal, and private protected.

Example: AccessmodifierKeyWord class explains each modifier and its use case.

2. Encapsulation
Implemented through properties with get and set.

Example: PropertiesandEncapsulation class hides sensitive fields and provides controlled access.

3. Inheritance
Classes reuse fields and methods from a base class using the : syntax.

Example:

Vehicle ‚Üí base class

Car inherits from Vehicle

Animal is inherited by Dog and Pig

4. Polymorphism
Methods are overridden in derived classes to change behavior.

Example:

Animal.animalSound() overridden in Dog and Pig

5. Abstraction
Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

Example:

Country (abstract class)

Palestine inherits and implements abstract methods

IBook (interface) implemented by MyBook

6. Interfaces
Show how a class can implement multiple contracts.

Example: MyBook implements IBook interface.

7. Constructors & Method Overloading
Parameterless and parameterized constructors to initialize objects.

Example:

Car() sets default values

Car(string, int, string, int) allows custom initialization

üìñ Learning Goals
By exploring this code, you will:

Understand when and why to use each OOP concept in C#.

Learn the difference between abstract classes and interfaces.

Gain confidence in writing maintainable, reusable code.

Improve understanding of C# syntax and OOP best practices.
